<p>
Blockchain technology has evolved from the time it had been introduced to the planet
through Bitcoin into a general-purpose technology with use cases in many industries including
healthcare. To know the state-of-the-art of the appliance of blockchain technology in healthcare,
we conducted a scientific review during which we created the map of all relevant research using
the systematic mapping study process. Specifically, the intentions of the study were to spot the
blockchain technology use cases in healthcare, the instance applications that are developed for
these use cases, the challenges and restrictions of the blockchain-based healthcare applications,
the present approaches employed in developing these applications and areas for future research.
Our study shows that blockchain has many healthcare use cases including the running of
electronic medical records and pharmaceutical supply chain management, biomedical research
and education, remote patient monitoring, health data analytics, among others. Variety of
blockchain-based healthcare applications are developed as prototypes supported emerging
blockchain paradigms, like smart contracts, permissioned blockchain, off-chain storage, etc.
However, more research still must be conducted to raised understand, characterize and evaluate
the utility of blockchain technology in healthcare. Further research is additionally needed to
supplement ongoing efforts to deal with the challenges of scalability, latency, interoperability,
security and privacy in reference to the utilization of blockchain technology in healthcare.

<h4>Limitations </h4>
<p>
We have tried build our project using Ethereum, ganache, metamask for building smart
contracts for our project but for that we need a proper Linux machine with some of their
requirements in which our machine was lacking behind. We even tried virtual machines and
virtual box but that fully crashed out system resulting for reinstalling and formatting the whole
system.
